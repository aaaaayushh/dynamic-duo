                The Curiosity Rover Co. has extremely humble 
                beginnings. Born out of the minds of two extremely bored, but 
                hardworking, engineers who realized the potential the rental 
                industry held after all the existing companies 
                went up in flames, literally.
            </p>
            <p style='color:white; font-family:"Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace'> 
                After years of hard work, we are proud to say that the curiosity
                is now up and running in all the planets our species has successfully colonized
                since the eradication of all life on Earth.

                Just like the Curiosity rover we were supposed to last 14 days but
                it's been 14 years and we're still going strong.
